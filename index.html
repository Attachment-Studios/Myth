		<h3>About Myth</h3>
		<p id="abt1">Myth is a digital assistant that has ability to perform many tasks. 
			The tasks include saying time, searching, informing, playing musics and videos on YouTube and even more. 
			It also has some fun things like joking demand and if lucky enough, you may also find some easter eggs by saying random stuff. 
		</p><br>
		<p id="abt2">
			For more it is easy to use. 
			If you can not speak it's name, then just change it to something you can easily say.
		</p><br>
		<p id="abt3">
			Myth might be a complex AI assistant but it will never try to steal your data.
			It is coded like that. 
			The only thing it can access from you is your name that you fit, not myth. 
			Though it is safer to use.
